# MachineLearningProject
Written in Python for COT4501</br>
Download the Iris and Wine datasets available at the UCI Machine Learning repository in the platform of 
your choice. Download two other datasets (separately chosen by each group). Describe the datasets in your 
final project submission.</br>
Execute a homegrown least-squares classifier on the 4 datasets with identical choices of training and test set 
patterns. Document the mis-classification errors (and separate out each class errors as well) for both the the 
least-squares classifiers. Document the settings of the free parameters for each dataset. Give a high level 
summary of your findings based on your interpretation of the results. Use the rubric below (the one labeled 
with “2” for more information.)
